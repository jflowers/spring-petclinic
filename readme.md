# Spring PetClinic Sample Application

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using Gradle. 

First start a [Create a CodeReady Worskpace](https://codeready-appdev-opentlc.apps.cluster-tysons-d7da.tysons-d7da.example.opentlc.com/f?url=http://gogs-appdev-opentlc.apps.cluster-tysons-d7da.tysons-d7da.example.opentlc.com/gogs/spring-petclinic/raw/master/devfile.yaml) then you can build a jar file and run it from the command line:

```
cd spring-petclinic
gradle bootJar
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Or you can run it from Gradle directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
gradle bootRun
```

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data. A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.

You could start MySql locally with whatever installer works for your OS, or with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

Further documentation is provided [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/master/src/main/resources/db/mysql/petclinic_db_setup_mysql.txt).

## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are
[quite a few forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) in a special GitHub org
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic). If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.


## Interaction with other open source projects

One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found some bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days.
Here is a list of them:

| Name | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Spring JDBC: simplify usage of NamedParameterJdbcTemplate | [SPR-10256](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10256) and [SPR-10257](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10257) |
| Bean Validation / Hibernate Validator: simplify Maven dependencies and backward compatibility |[HV-790](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-790) and [HV-792](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-792) |
| Spring Data: provide more flexibility when working with JPQL queries | [DATAJPA-292](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAJPA-292) |
